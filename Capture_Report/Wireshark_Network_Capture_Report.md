# Wireshark Network Capture – Short Report
Date of Capture: 11 Aug 2025

Interface Used: Ethernet (active network interface)

Capture Duration: ~1 minute

## Top 3 Protocols Detected:
1. TCP – 1,474 packets – Used for reliable data transmission between devices.

2. QUIC – 1,466 packets – Modern transport protocol used mainly for faster, secure web traffic (often with HTTP/3).

3. TLSv1.3 – 1,292 packets – Encryption protocol ensuring secure communication over the network.

## Summary of Findings:
The captured traffic shows a mix of encrypted and transport-layer communication, indicating normal secure web browsing activity. QUIC and TLSv1.3 suggest the use of modern, secure web protocols, while TCP remains the underlying transport for certain connections. No suspicious patterns were detected in this short capture.

## Conclusion:
The network is functioning normally, with the majority of captured packets relating to secure and reliable data transmission.
